<h2>Introduction</h2>

As a botmaster, we always went to make our bot fail proof, sometimes bot users may misspell some words and due to that bot is unable to reply with the proper answer, in such case we can replace that misspelt word with a correct word and bot will reply with a perfect answer. 
<br /><br />
Chatbot will log wrong spells itself and ask you for a correct replacement.

<h2>Steps to replace a wrong spell</h2>


From the left menu click on Teach bot option, then select spelling replacement, you'll be redirected to spelling replacement module. 
<br /><br />
There you'll find the list of misspelt spellings, choose the spelling you want to replace with correct one, click on edit button, it will open a model for you where you could write your correct spelling and click on submit. 
<br /><br />
From next time if users use a wrong spell bot will automatically correct it and reply to the users.
