<h2>Introduction</h2>

Zirki.ai is a chatbot building platform where someone without any technical or programming knowledge can build chatbots for their organisation and venture.
<br /><br />
It provides you ease of access to the simplest web interface for building your chatbot which could be placed on any messaging platform or on your website.

Before getting started to build your first chatbot with zirki.ai just make sure you have a facebook account and a facebook page with proper admin rights.

<h3>Step One</h3>

<h4>Log in to Facebook and choose your page to create the bot.</h4>

The first step we are going to take is establishing our chatbot on a facebook page for that go to https://zirki.ai and click on "Get Started for Free" Button. It will ask you permission for very first time, you may choose your facebook page about what you want to give permission.
<br /><br />
Then you'll be redirected to the connect page where you have to select your Facebook page. As soon as you select your page your Chatbot has created, to test that you may say "HI" to it on your facebook page and it will reply you.
