<h2>Introduction</h2>

Teaching conversation to the chatbot is a time-consuming task, and sometimes we already have a huge chat history from previous logs, adding them manually one by one is not a good way of teaching to bot.
<br /><br />
To overcome this situation Zirki.ai provide Bulk teach facility which allows you to teach conversation to bot in one shot via excel file.
